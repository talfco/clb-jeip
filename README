This is a fork of Joseph Scott's Jquery Edit in Place (JEIP) javascript library which I adjusted to my needs.
The original library can be found under:
http://josephscott.org/code/javascript/jquery-edit-in-place/ 
All the credits for this nice library goes to him.

Dependecies to
1. datejs
2. log4javascript.js
3. bootstrap-datepick
